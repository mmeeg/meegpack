# meegpack
Information:

Meegpack is a work in progress resource pack that gives an overhaul to entity animations, utility for redstone & pvp and a stylized vanilla friendly improvement of default look of Minecraft.

This pack is personal and has minor tweaks to the game and a lot of inside jokes to the Minecraft server Feather64 formally known as StraightUpSurvival the server IP as of posting is: feather64.net

(Feel free to use this pack and the features included in any way you wish)

This Resource Pack requires Optifine but I also supply a Vanilla version of meegpack. (note vanilla versions of meegpack have reduced features and no mob animations)
